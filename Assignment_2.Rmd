I. RESEARCH QUESTION

The turnout rate is influenced by many factors that may be related to age, race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status and political/economical situation of the country. In this broad spectrum of variables that influence participation of voters in elections, this article will focus specifically on whether youth unemployment has an impact on turnout in the case of Spain. Youth unemployment has been a pressing issue in the country for a long time now since the period of time 2000-2016, youth unemployment (unemployed youth from 16 to 24 years old) had never been lower than 17.5\% (Source: Eurostat).

We are also interested to see if youth unemployment movilize voters with more intensity in regions where there is more young people. If this is the case, this effect can come from three different sources: because older people feel the resposability to vote more given the amount of young people unemployed, because young people go to vote more or because of a combination of the two factors above.

This case study is interesting for the recent change in the political system of the country, that went from a party system traditionally dominated by the PP (center-right) and the PSOE (center-left) to a multy party system where the Podemos (left) and Ciudadanos (liberal/center-right) reached the national parliament with a significant vote share in the recent national elections. Our guess is that, since youth unemployment rates in Spain was significantly high in recent years as a result of the euro crisis reaching 48.1\%  in 2015 (Source: Eurostat), young voters turnout or other kind of voters infleunced by their feeling of responsability towards young people were among the reasons to explain why the party system changed so drastically in recent years.  

II. Theory 

Our theory is that turnout is positively impacted by the youth unemployment rates and even going further, that the effect of youth unemployment on tunout depends positively on the amount of young people. 

In order to analyze this relation statistically, we propose the following model:


$Turnout_{i,t}=\beta_0+\beta_1 Youth\ Unemployment_{i,t}+\beta_2 \% Young\ People + \beta_3 Youth\ Unemployment*\% Young\ People + \delta_i + u_{i,t}$

where $i$ represents each of the 17 regions (Autonomus Communities) of Spain, $t$ represent the most recent years where general elections where held: 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2015 and $\delta_i$ represents regional fixed effects. 

The coefficients of interest are $\beta_1$ and $\beta_3$

LITERATURE REVIEW:

Literature on voter behavior tend to rely mainly on the incumbency-oriented hypothesis, which claims that voters tend to reward or punish government in elections according to the economic performance of the country (CHANGE @dassonneville2013economic). In that sense, objective or subjective economic indicators such as unemployment rates, inflation, growth and other related aspects have the potential to explain part of the variance in government support (@lewis2000economic). Citizen dissatisfaction with economic performance substantially increases the possibility to vote against the incumbent. While some authors believe that the state of employment does not have a detectable effect upon voting behavior (@stigler1973general), others have reasons to believe that unemployment rates play a role depending on the political identification of the incumbent party (@dassonneville2013economic), with left-wing governments suffering more from hign unemployment rates than right-wing governments (CHECK).

it is even more important
than long-term factors such as partisan identification, because of its greater
volatility 




In many democracies, the population has been increasingly using internet to get information, discuss political issues or participate in the political process. Also, in autocracies, internet is said to be a driver for political change, in some cases. 

## Research Question

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Basic Literature Review

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Data Sources

```{r cars}
```

## Methodology

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
